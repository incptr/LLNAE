# Language Learning with Netflix - Anki Exporter
LLNAE is a small app, designed to capture flashcards in the background while watching Netflix with the extension "Language learning with Netflix" for Google Chrome. It can be used in the different modes allowing for manual capturing, following along and quick extraction.

LLNAE provides a flashcard deck viewer that allows the user to delete and favorite cards as well as an exporter. This generates a csv file that can be directly imported into Anki. Furthermore, it can provide phonetic transcription by searching for words in a IPA dictionary. 

## Requirements
In order for LLNAE to work properly, Google Chrome needs to be run in sandboxing programme. This is needed in order to avoid Netflixes screenshot blocking mechanism. A common choice for sandboxing is Sandboxie https://sandboxie-plus.com/downloads/ 

Furthermore the "Language learning with Netflix" extension needs to be installed. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/hoombieeljmmljlkjmnheibnpciblicm?hl=en
